Family and informal carers often provide care for as long as it is physically and mentally feasible. Arrangements may change as care demands increase in the later stages of dementia.

    "text_02": "The lived experience of caring for an individual with dementia can often be isolating and result in a range of difficult emotions, particularly when one partner is the sole carer. Feelings of frustration or blame directed towards their relative can cause feelings of guilt, for a condition that is beyond anyone's control. These feelings can make it more difficult for partners to reach out for support. It is not uncommon for ambulance staff to be faced with an expectation from care partners to take the patient to hospital as they are exhausted and want the time-out.  It is also important to factor in that care partners may have their own health conditions to contend with. Signposting care partners to local support services can help acknowledge the value of everyone's wellbeing and raise awareness about available support in advance to reduce the risk of carer burnout and crisis.",

    "text_03":"Another potential means to support a person with dementia to live well is to seek the assistance from care agencies who can provide regular visits or live-in carers. Note, that advice on this subject may be perceived by family carers as a failure, on their part, to accept external support. It is important to broach the topic of seeking professional care with sensitivity and assure family carers that it is acceptable to ask for help. The first step is to contact the local authority for a care and support needs assessment. Funding for social care provision is usually means tested with some exceptions* but everyone is entitled to access a needs assessment regardless of income.",

Care homes may also be able to provide support on a temporary (respite) basis.
