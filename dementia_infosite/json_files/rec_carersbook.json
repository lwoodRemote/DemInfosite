Person centred care documents can be completed with or by someone who knows the person and their wishes and may include information on a person's cultural or religious beliefs; important people or possessions in their lives as well as their preferences and routines. These documents can help professionals deliver care that meets a person's individual needs, thereby improving the patient experience. Person centred care documents can also be used to quickly identify wishes and priorities when other forms of communication aren't possible.\n\nThese documents differ from the 'message in a bottle' which is stored in the fridge and contains a useful summary of information for emergencies. Person centred care documents are designed to record more detailed information about a person's needs, likes and dislikes and therefore, should ideally travel with a person if they are going into hospital or any new care setting.",

An Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment is a legally binding document.\n\nAdvance Statements (or Advance Care Plans) allow a person to record their wishes, feelings, beliefs and values in case they later become unwell and need care or medical treatment. An Advanced Statement is not legally binding, however the person's views and wishes should be understood and taken into consideration if they need care or medical treatment.\n\nAn Advance Decision only covers refusals of medical treatment, whereas an Advance Statement can include any information that a person feels is important in relation to their health or care. Many people will have both an Advanced Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT), and an Advanced Statement recording their wishes, feelings, beliefs and values about future care should they become unable to make or communicate decisions themselves.",

Additional Information in the SCR, such as details of long-term conditions, significant medical history, or specific communication needs, is now included by default for patients with an SCR, unless they have previously told the NHS that they did not want this information to be shared (NHS Digital, 2022)."
