These can be useful when it is not possible to see what's inside without opening something, for example, wooden doors. The use of visual signs could prevent a person having to try multiple places to find what they are looking for, which may reduce frustration and increase independence. The presence of written signs and visual labels in a home environment should prompt us to find out what additional support may be needed to provide person centred care to an individual.",
