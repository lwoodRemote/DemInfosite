    "text_01": "As dementia progresses this can increase the risk of social isolation and staff may notice a person appears lonely or isolated, especially if they spend long periods of time on their own. Risk factors for social isolation include being bereaved, having other long term health conditions or limited access to transport. In order to live well with dementia a person may need increased support to participate in social activities, for example practical help with transport or technical support with accessing the internet to stay connected. Ambulance staff can offer to signpost people to local or national dementia charities and organisations who can advise on the activities and support available for people of all ages living with dementia.",

    "text_02": "Exercise is beneficial for physical and mental health and may improve the quality of life for people at all stages of dementia. Physical activity creates opportunities to socialise with others, for example by walking together or attending a group exercise class, and can help improve and maintain a person's independence. Activities are available to meet varied abilities and range from gentle seated chair exercises to walking or cycling groups and outdoor adventure activities. Some activities are run specifically for people with dementia and many existing exercise groups advertise a 'dementia friendly' approach and welcome people with dementia to participate, consider signposting them to charities or organisations who will be able to advise on what's available locally for people living with dementia."
