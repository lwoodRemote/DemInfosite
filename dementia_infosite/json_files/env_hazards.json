    "text_01": "It is not uncommon to notice hoarding habits, whether by stockpiling or replacing misplaced items. This may be a longstanding situation, or a more recent behaviour attributed to memory loss and the individual with dementia trying to stay in control of their lives. Although people have a right to live how they choose, hoarding may not always be an active choice to keep items but rather a cumulative effect of belongings building up over time to the extent that the person is no longer able to move around their home safely. Concerns about increased hoarding behaviour may suggest that a person is struggling to manage and may have care and support needs. Clutter can become overwhelming when items need to be located and may be dangerous when having to navigate the obstacles which they have created. There is also a fire risk with excess clutter, especially for smokers. Consider if a safeguarding referral is required if the person is at risk of harm and unable to protect themselves.",

    "text_02": "As dementia progresses a familiar environment can be increasingly important in providing reassurance and routine to a person with dementia. If any furnishings or items need to be moved during a non-emergency patient visit, whenever possible put these back as found to maintain familiarity of the room layout for the individual. Try to avoid rearranging items unless something poses as a trip hazard or unsafe obstacle."
